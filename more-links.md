This document provides additional links and more material to learn Python.

## Tutorials

- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science) offers different Python tutorials. I think TUM gives you free access to DataCamp.
- There are tutorials for all basic concepts on [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).
- [Codecadamy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/python) also has a lot of (paid) Python tutorials.

I have collected some tutorials and guides to help you learn Python. Tutorials are great to show you some concepts and to get you on your way but I can say from experience that there quickly is a point of diminishing returns.

The best way to learn a language is through practice. Look for a project that you are excited about or try to implement something you already did in another language in Python. Find your way through the documentation of certain packages or look for tutorials for more specific use-cases.

This way, you will quickly learn many things you would otherwise never come in contact. You will have look for packages, go through documentation, try out code, debug problems, and search google for solutions.

After you have done a few projects, you are ready to start thinking about Python code on a meta level.

- What is the best way to structure your code?
- How can you make sure it is correct?
- Where do you want to deploy your code to?
- How do you make sure you understand what you were trying to do with a certain function in three months from now or when you have not looked at the function's code for a few months?
- How can you make sure others can read and understand your code quickly?

## Advanced materials

If you have worked with Python a little bit and want to understand in more detail how things work or how to use it efficiently, I have some suggestions for you.

One of the best Python educators is [Raymond Hettinger](https://twitter.com/raymondh?lang=de). He has a lot of great talks on YouTube:

- [Modern Dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33CVV29OG8&t=2s)
- [The Mental Game of Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANN2Eu6ZnM&t=442s)
- [Dataclasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TwcmT6Rcw)
- [Best practices for beautiful intelligible code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M)

[Brandon Rhodes](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/) is a great educator as well.

- One of my favourite talks of him is the one about [clean architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJtef410XaM).
- [His website](https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/) has his greatest hits and I can recommend the talks and tutorials to everyone.
- He has a [long tutorial for pandas](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pycon-pandas-tutorial) that is perfect for people that want to get deep into pandas. **Also useful for beginners**.

# Preparation

These are the steps you should take to prepare for this course.

## Install Python

Please install Python 3.11 on your system.

### Windows

Download the [installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.3/python-3.11.3-amd64.exe) and use it to install Python. Please note two things:

- Make sure that you enable the option to add Python to your PATH.
- Enable the option to install the Python Launcher for Windows.

After the installation, one of these commands in the terminal should work for you:

- `python -m pip list`
- `py -m pip list`

It should print a short list of standard packages you have installed.

Next, open PowerShell (you can search for it in your Windows start menu search) as an administrator (right click on the icon and select "Run as Administrator") and run the following:

`Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force`

This will make sure you can run Python scripts.

### Linux

If you are on Linux, you will probably know how to install Python on your distro. If not, please ask us for help.
